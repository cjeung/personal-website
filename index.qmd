## About
Hello! Thanks for visiting! My name is Carly and I'm currently a 4th-year Statistics and Data Science major, Digital Humanities minor at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). This quarter I'm taking four classes: Statistical Consulting, Machine Learning, Applied Sampling, and Digital Storytelling, while also searching for opportunities following my Spring 2024 graduation.

This website includes my [resume](resume.pdf), information about my work experience, and projects I've worked on.
